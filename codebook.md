## Variable Names:

1. Subjects
2. ActivityDescription
3. Features
4. Average

## Variable Descriptions:

###1. Subjects: 
#####Unique ID for participants, ranging from 1 to 30

###2. ActivityDescription: 
#####Description of Activity performed by the participant

###3. Features: 

#####These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

1.  tBodyAcc-XYZ
2.	tGravityAcc-XYZ
3.	tBodyAccJerk-XYZ
4.	tBodyGyro-XYZ
5.	tBodyGyroJerk-XYZ
6.	tBodyAccMag
7.	tGravityAccMag
8.	tBodyAccJerkMag
9.	tBodyGyroMag
10.	tBodyGyroJerkMag
11.	fBodyAcc-XYZ
12.	fBodyAccJerk-XYZ
13.	fBodyGyro-XYZ
14.	fBodyAccMag
15.	fBodyAccJerkMag
16.	fBodyGyroMag
17.	fBodyGyroJerkMag

mean(): Mean value
std(): Standard deviation
meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

1.  gravityMean
2.	tBodyAccMean
3.	tBodyAccJerkMean
4.	tBodyGyroMean
5.	tBodyGyroJerkMean


Overall 86 such variables.

###4. Average: 
#####Average of each of the above Features for each Activity and each Subject
